# Lingumi Software Engineering Challenge (nodejs)

Hello! This is the Lingumi Software Engineering Challenge for nodejs. The purpose of this repository is to give you (someone interested in a technical position at Lingumi) a chance to show that you can perform the more technical parts of the role.

First off, let's discuss some ground rules:

## Ground Rules

- **You have 7 days to complete the challenge**: the clock starts from when you received the email containing the challenge. If you need extra time, email us
- **Do-it-yourself**: we have no sophisticated anti-cheating mechanism, just plain honour and trust. Please don't:
    - ask someone else to do the test for you/help you on the test
    - copy-paste a solution from the web
- You **are allowed to consult docs** or google small technical details (e.g. Javascript's `String` API)
- **Tell us how to run the code** as well as how to change the input parameters to test different input cases.
- **Commit all your code**. We can't assess something we can't see.
- **Use version control**. We'd be slightly disappointed if there's only one commit with a finished solution.
- **Show your best**. We're not timing it so that you complete it within a short period of time - instead we'd prefer taking that extract time to show us what your "best code" could look like.
- **Imagine you're working in a team** and this is a shared project repository. Leave the code and repository in a state that would allow someone else to take over.

## What we're looking for

The primary purpose of this exercise is to see how you tackle a programming task independently that is semi-open ended. In addition, we've tried to construct this in a way that simulates working in a collaborative project as we want to see how you would contribute to a shared code base (This isn’t a code golf or competitive programming problem).

Roughly speaking, we will look at:

- whether the code works
- how you solved the challenge
- the state of the repo
- the state of the code

We're not going to judge whether you use “tabs or spaces”, but we'll be assessing non-functional points such as variable naming, code organization, commits and testing (if you do add tests - include it in the repo!). Try and show evidence of what your "best code" could look like.

## Challenge Specification

The challenge will be sent to you via email, triggering the beginning of the 7 day window. This will include details no what exactly we’re expecting to see as part of the repo - in addition to what is described here.

**You must include at least one test case**. This is to ensure that we both know your code can compile and run before submission. It doesn't matter what the test case actually does, so long as it runs your function with the some defined parameters. 

This repository is the skeleton repository for node.js. It contains three files:

- README.md - the instructions (this text)
- index.js - the main entry point for the challenge. It’s currently blank.
- .gitignore - currently the default node gitignore file

You are free to edit or delete any of these files, as well as add any of your own. Alternatively, you don’t have to use this repository at all, but create your own.

However you must host your final solution as a Git repository - and send us a link to it on completion of the challenge. This can be a private repository, and we can work out details about permissions via email.

# Running the Code

To run the code, by default we will expect that running `node index.js` will run at least one test case. In addition, to run our own test cases, we will go in and edit index.js.

Please provide instructions on:

- how to run the code (if requires more steps than cloning the repo and running `node index.js`)
- how to edit the input parameters to run the code with our input parameters

## Environment

We will be using node version 8.9.1. If you require another version of node, please say so.

## Steps

1. Duplicate this repository (not fork) - [Instructions Here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/)
	- You don’t have to use Github - [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) has free private repos
2. Complete the challenge sent via email
3. Ensure you’ve added all the required documentation/set up we’ve asked for - including instructions on how to run and edit the test case
4. Send us an email to confirm that you've completed the exercise with a link to the repo (the repo can be public or private)

Any questions about the challenge or how it works please email us.
